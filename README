This is a playground where Niklaus would like to set-up a 
very easy to install elexis environment for medical practitioner.

Typical setup is:
- OC (Elexis-OperationCenter) is responsible for infrastructure & setup
- Firewall is either managed by the practitioner or the OC (pcengine.ch/ipfire)
- Server (GNU/Debian-Linux) based managed by th OC. Somewhere in the medical cabinet
  HW: Any x86 server should do the jobs, may be virtualized, e.g. Archivista.ch
  SW: Database-Server
  Optional: x2goserver based on KDE/Gnome
  Optional: Wiki, whatever the practitioner is wishing and willing to pay
- Backup: eSata/NAS (at least 2 pieces regulary swapped in a safe place, e.g. 
  a safe in a Swiss bank
- Optional: Linux/MacOSX/Win?? PC with full elexis installation
- Optional: ThinClient (inside cabinet or via internet) using x2go

Tools used are (among a lot of others):
- simple-cdd (Custom Debian Distribution)
- puppet
