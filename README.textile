This is a playground where Niklaus would like to set-up a 
very easy to install elexis environment for medical practitioner.

h2. Typical setup

* OC (Elexis-OperationCenter) is responsible for infrastructure & setup
* Firewall is either managed by the practitioner or the OC (pcengine.ch/ipfire)
* Server (GNU/Debian-Linux) based managed by th OC. Somewhere in the medical cabinet
**  HW: Any x86 server should do the jobs, may be virtualized, e.g. Archivista.ch
**  SW: Database-Server
**  Optional: x2goserver based on KDE/Gnome
**  Optional: Wiki, whatever the practitioner is wishing and willing to pay
* Backup: eSata/NAS (at least 2 pieces regulary swapped in a safe place, e.g. a safe in a Swiss bank
* Optional: Linux/MacOSX/Win?? PC with full elexis installation
* Optional: ThinClient (inside cabinet or via internet) using x2go
* Optional: Backup on encrypted HD disks, also on remote location using a Raspberry-PI

h2. Tools used (among a lot of others)

* GNU/Debian/Linux
* veewee
* virtualbox or kvm 
* vagrant
* puppet with hiera, augeas, facter
* ruby (with a lot of rubygems, bundler)
* java
* mysql or postgresql for the database server
* Samba for sharing network drives with MacOSX and Windows users
